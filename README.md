## 🏗️ Architecture

### Modular Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Lesson.jsx          # Reusable lesson display component
│   └── LearningPath.jsx    # Learning path management component
├── data/
│   ├── financial-foundations.json

```

### JSON-Based Content Management
Each learning path is stored as a JSON file containing:
- Path metadata (title, description, duration)
- Lesson array with structured content
- Progress tracking information

Example lesson structure:
```json
{
  "id": "lesson-id",
  "title": "Lesson Title",
  "content": "Main lesson content...",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section Title",
      "content": "Section content..."
    }
  ],
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Key point 1",
    "Key point 2"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Action item 1",
    "Action item 2"
  ]
}
```
